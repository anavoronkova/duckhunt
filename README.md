# 🦆 Welcome to DuckQuest Challenge

## 🗺️ The Mission
You’ve received a set of **corrupted maps**. Each one hides the location of a secret duck — a QR code taped somewhere on campus.

Your job is to **fix each map manually** and use the `map_evaluator` program to verify your solution.

Each map leads to **one duck**. There are **five maps** in total.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Correct the broken map** (yes, by hand).
2. **Run it through the evaluator**:
   ```bash
   ./map_evaluator fixed_map.txt
   ```
3. If the map is correct, the program will reveal the **exact workstation location**.
4. Go to that station IRL, look **under the keyboard**, and grab the QR code (that’s your duck).
5. Bring the QR code to the **Café** to complete the challenge.

## 🏁 Rules & Tips
- If the duck is already gone, someone beat you to it. Try another map.
- Each QR code is a physical flag — only one per map.
- You must bring the **actual QR code** to the Café to win.

## 🐣 Good Luck
Fix the maps. Find the ducks. Win eternal duck glory.

Let the hunt begin!
