#ðŸ¦† DuckQuest Challenge

You've got maps, you've got a map evaluator. No need to explain what to do.

There are five winning flags. Once you find a flag, grab it and bring it back to the CafÃ©. If you find the location of one and itâ€™s already taken, just move on and try another map.

Happy hunting!
